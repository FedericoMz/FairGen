# FairGen
A dataset pre-processing, fairness-enhancing framework, concurrently balancing multiple binary and non-binary sensitive attributes by replacing biased records with synthetic records created through a genetic algorithm.

This is a **legacy repository** for the first public version of the project, discussed in [my Master's thesis](https://etd.adm.unipi.it/t/etd-06012022-053415/).

For the latest version of the code, see _**[GenFair](https://github.com/FedericoMz/GenFair)**_.
